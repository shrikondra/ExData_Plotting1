###About
Project1 of EDA course

##Sypnosis
The goal here was simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 by reproducing a series of four plots. 

##Data
This project used data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/),
* [Electric power consumption Dataset (20Mb)](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

* Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 
Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

##How to Run
* plot1("household_power_consumption.txt")  -> saves plot1.png
* plot2("household_power_consumption.txt")  -> saves plot2.png
* plot3("household_power_consumption.txt")  -> saves plot3.png
* plot4("household_power_consumption.txt")  -> saves plot4.png
